# Electric Feed System

### Objective:

The objective of the EFS project is to design, build, and test an electric feed system using COTS parts and in-house manufacturing for the PSAS LV4 liquid fueled bi-propellant rocket engine prototype by June 6, 2017.

### Project Team Members:

Name                | GitHub Username | Current Role
--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------
Jordan Roland       | @JSRoland       | Project Coordinator
Johnny C. Froehlich | @JordParma      | Design Engineer; Testing
Mimi Shang          | @mimishang      | Control Systems Engineer; Testing
Johnathan Talik     | @jtalik         | Manufacturing Engineer
Rawand Rasheed      | @rawand12       | Control Systems Engineer
James Luce          | @luceja         | Thermal/fluids Engineer

### EFS Requirements:

1. Design and bench test a technology development platform for the electric pump system.
2. Design and test a custom power system for EFS motor and system controls.
3. Design for the existing LFE (target chamber pressure of 350 - 400 psi)
4. The pump must be constructed from COTS components.
5. Parallel work with Carbon Fiber Propellant Tank (CFPT) team to optimize vehicle integration.
6. IPython design tool to generate pump requirements based on engine/vehicle level parameters.    
7. Produce the following documentation:
    - EFS testing, handling, and troubleshooting procedures
	- EFS Design Methodology & Design Process
    - Complete bill of materials

    #### Stretch Goals:
    - Integration with existing Liquid Fuelled Engine Test Stand (LFETS)
    - Completed live health monitoring and emergency shutdown provisions
    - Cold fire LN2 testing
    - Cold fire LOX testing
    - Hot  fire LOX testing

### Design Challenges:

To name a few...
1. Need for a simple, lightweight, and easily manufactured pump suited to produce high heads at low flow  rates.
2. Engine/vehicle requirements define the need for a feed system that is a radical departure from conventional design.
3. Using an unorthodox Barske open impeller design.
4. Hardware is physically small.
5. Shaft deflection, key stresses, fits for mounted components, and rotor dynamics must be seriously considered.
6. Simplifying a detailed fabrication process.

### Outcomes:

1. Detailed design explanation.
2. EFS technology development platform.
3. Manufacturing/controls/testing procedures.
4. Completed EFS water test assembly with part drawings and 3-axis CNC machine code for reproducibility.
5. Evaluation of pump performance and accompanying documentation e.g., Performance curves, BEP, spec sheets, future work.
6. Open Source GitHub repository.
