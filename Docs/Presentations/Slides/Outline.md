## Story: 

small things to change:
 - match colors on plots from example to performance curve
 - update load cell and RPM on measurements slide, not homebrew optical, one pressure picture
 - on literature review, show impellers in a simpler manner? maybe actually use final cad images there?
 - requirements wrong on requirements slide

---

1. **Brief team introduction** @luceja
- [ ] Title Slide, Team members introduce stuff

---

2. **Problem description** @luceja

##### Slides:

- [x] The problem: getting rockets to go higher (the rocket equation)
- [x] normally solid fuel, and problems with liquid fuel solutions
- [x] electric motor pump a good solution (battery energy density, etc)

---

3. **Key Customer requirements** @JordParma

- Show just the most important customer requirements
- Make sure that the customer requirements are not only important, but clearly understandable to the (smart, professional)   audience

##### Slides:

- [ ] Outline high level reqs. (Words in tables)
- [ ] What makes them important to the success of the project. 


---

4. **Key performance metrics** @JordParma

- How did we measure design outcomes so that it meets customer requirements

##### Slides:

> Combine with #3

- [ ] Outline upper and lower limits on meeting reqs. (Words in tables)

> Add yes/no or checkmark for reqs. ONLY. Performance vs. requirments happens in #9

---
5. **Final Design and Subsystems breakdown** @jtalik

##### Slides:

Final design:
- [ ] High Level
	-  Flow Diagram of the testing apparatus - Diagram 
	-  Actual testing assembly - Hig-res photo

Subsystems breakdown:
- [ ] Pump 
	- Bearing
	- Seals 
	- Hydraulic assembly (volute, impeller, difusser)
		-Highlight the modular design for testing
	- Shaft / Coupling
	- Motor Dynomometer
	- Motor / ESC / Batteries / motor control 

	- [ ] inlcude quater section - CAD (one on poster)
	- [ ] include photo of pump w/ casing + motor mount
	- [ ] include photo of motor control - High res photo (one on poster)

- [ ] Testing
	- Testing Apparatus
	- Sensing 
		- Pressure, Flow, RPM, Torque, ect... 
	- Data Aquisition 
		- Ardunino and excel 

	- [ ] Include diagram of testing -  Diagram
	- [ ] Include high-res photo of testing apparatus - Photo
	- [ ] Include high res photo of the control / measurement apparatus - Photo

6. **Design concepts** @JordParma

- Give an example of your creative thinking in generating concepts
- Provide some evidence of how you selected viable concepts
- Show conceptually how your design works

##### Slides:

- [ ] What is our engineering methodology? Make smart/concrete decisions and smart/concrete guesses. DISAGREE AND COMMIT!
      fail and fail again until we get what we want. Lets be a little romantic here. People love that shit

> Can maybe group these three into one or two slides or just the general idea.

- [ ] Use IPyNb to demonstrate how we guided ourselves into the realm of our req engine/vehicle performance
- [ ] Use IPyNb to demonstrate selecting viable impeller concept (Maybe move to #5)
- [ ] Use IPyNb to demonstrate determining power requirments

- [ ] Show a high level conceptual slide of how the pump works. Pressure/flow transfer etc. (I FUGGIN GOT DIS BOIS)

8. **Biggest challenges and solutions** @luceja
- Show one or at most two big problems that you overcame

PROBLEM: Designing, manufacturing, and testing a pump in-house

##### Slides:

- [x] Requirements meant that off shelf designs or parts (impellers, etc) wouldn't be usable.. have to make everything (graphic of parts that we had to make)
- [x] The level of precision (concentricity and lengths) was critical (rpms, loads, vibration)... graphic series of impeller and housing > shaft > everything
- [ ] dynamometer problem and design

---

7. **Final performance vs. Key Customer requirements** @JordParma

- Show how, or to what degree, your design meets the key requirements. This is the second half of the climax of your talk.
- Show proof of how well you have solved your problem

##### Slides:

- [ ] Let the data drop cause the shit is fire! Go easy on em though. 

> I need some time to plot.

- [ ] What does it mean? Did we hit our mark?

---

9. **Conclusion – Recap your story** @luceja

- Where you started – Customer requirements
- Where you ended – proof of satisfying customer requirements

##### Slides:

- [ ] intiial requirements are met (repeat earlier slide with results checked)
- [ ] results matched theory: the design is valid and can be scaled for psas use

---

10. **Recommendations for next steps** @both

- Any unfinished pieces?
- What you learned
- What should be done next

##### Slides:

- [ ] ongoing h2o testing: 
	- further testing of the variables we have control over
	- thorough data analysis
	- possibly additional variables to control (what is ideal diffuser, impeller)
- [ ] scaling and cryo/flight ready design

## Notes:

#### Possible Questions from audience:

1. Why use centrifugal pump (vs other high head / low flow like piston)
2. 
3.
