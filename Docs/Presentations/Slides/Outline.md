## Story: 

1. **Brief team introduction** 
- [ ] Title Slide, Team members introduce stuff

---

2. **Problem description** @JordParma

- Motivation: Why should we care
- Project Objective Statement: Goal in a nutshell

##### Slides:

- [ ] Who is PSAS and what is their goal / Rockets are hard
- [ ] To achieve this goal we need new technology
- [ ] Blowdowns dont scale, turbines are too complex. Lets use a battery and a DC motor


---

3. **Key Customer requirements** @JordParma

- Show just the most important customer requirements
- Make sure that the customer requirements are not only important, but clearly understandable to the (smart, professional)   audience

##### Slides:

- [ ] Outline high level reqs. (Words in tables)
- [ ] What makes them important to the success of the project. 


---

4. **Key performance metrics** @JordParma

- How did we measure design outcomes so that it meets customer requirements

##### Slides:

> Combine with #3

- [ ] Outline upper and lower limits on meeting reqs. (Words in tables)

> Add yes/no or checkmark for reqs. ONLY. Performance vs. requirments happens in #9

---

5. **Biggest challenges and solutions** @jtalik

- Show one or at most two big problems that you overcame

##### Slides:

Impeller Caseing 
- [ ] Radical departure from conventional design. We needed a suitable impeller and caseing.
- [ ] This is how we solved it. Insanley quick overview of Barske geoometry, concentric partial emissions design
- [ ] 

Manufacturing/cost (Shit load of rad problems and solutions) How do we paint that picture?
- [ ]
- [ ] 

---

6. **Design concepts** @JordParma

- Give an example of your creative thinking in generating concepts
- Provide some evidence of how you selected viable concepts
- Show conceptually how your design works

##### Slides:

- [ ] What is our engineering methodology? Make smart/concrete decisions and smart/concrete guesses. DISAGREE AND COMMIT!
      fail and fail again until we get what we want. Lets be a little romantic here. People love that shit

> Can maybe group these three into one or two slides or just the general idea.

- [ ] Use IPYN to demonstrate how we guided ourselves into the realm of our req engine/vehicle performance
- [ ] Use IPYN to demonstrate selecting viable impeller concept (Maybe move to #5)
- [ ] Use IPYN to demonstrate determining power requirments

- [ ] Show a high level conceptual slide of how the pump works. Pressure/flow transfer etc. (I FUGGIN GOT DIS BOIS)

---

7. **Subsystems** @jtalik

- Show images of your key subsystem
- Show how the systems work together to solve the problem

##### Slides:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

---

8. **Final Design** @jtalik

- Summarize your final design – this is the first half of the climax of your talk

##### Slides:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

---

9. **Final performance vs. Key Customer requirements** @JordParma

- Show how, or to what degree, your design meets the key requirements. This is the second half of the climax of your talk.
- Show proof of how well you have solved your problem

##### Slides:

- [ ] Let the data drop cause the shit is fire! Go easy on em though. 

> I need some time to plot.

- [ ] What does it mean? Did we hit our mark?

---

10. **Conclusion – Recap your story** @jtalik

- Where you started – Customer requirements
- Where you ended – proof of satisfying customer requirements

##### Slides:

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

---

11. **Recommendations for next steps** @both

- Any unfinished pieces?
- What you learned
- What should be done next

##### Slides:

- [ ] Note about ongoing testing and results to come.
- [ ] What we learned? COT DAMN. We need to compress this.

- [ ] Future work slide
	- Further performance improvement investigation. Speed, impeller trim, etc,.
	- Revamp for cryo LN2 tests
	- Integrate with liquid engine test stand for LOX testing
	- VFD
	- 8 kN scaling
