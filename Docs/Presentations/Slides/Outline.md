## Story: 

1. **Brief team introduction** 
- [ ] Title Slide, Team members introduce stuff

2. **Problem description** @JordParma
- Motivation: Why should we care
- Project Objective Statement: Goal in a nutshell

##### Slides:

- [ ] Who is PSAS and what is their goal / Rockets are hard
- [ ] To achieve this goal we need new technology
- [ ] Blowdowns dont scale, turbines are too complex. Lets use a battery and a DC motor
- [ ]

3. **Key Customer requirements** @JordParma
- Show just the most important customer requirements
- Make sure that the customer requirements are not only important, but clearly understandable to the (smart, professional)   audience

5. **Biggest challenges and solutions** @jtalik
- Show one or at most two big problems that you overcame

PROBLEM: Designing and manufacturing a pump in-house

Vehicle requirements and physical/derivered quantites determine the given inputs and design requirements of such a pump.
No pumps exist that satisfy the requirements of resonable wieght and cost. 
Therefore, we start from square one with designing and developing a pump.  



- Impeller/Housing Design 
	- Non-Conventional Pump design

- Casing Design
	- Sealing 
		- High Pressure / High RPMs
	- Dynamic Considerations
		- High RPM 
		- Canteliever Impeller


PROBLEM: Testing a pump
Problems included:
- Power 
- Controls
- Measurement for determining a preformance curve

##### Slides:

Impeller Caseing 
- [ ] Radical departure from conventional design. We needed a suitable impeller and caseing.
- [ ] This is how we solved it. Insanley quick overview of Barske geoometry, concentric partial emissions design
- [ ] 

Manufacturing/cost (Shit load of rad problems and solutions) How do we paint that picture?
