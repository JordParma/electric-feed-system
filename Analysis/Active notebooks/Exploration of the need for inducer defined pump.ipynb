    "It has become apparent that the ethanol pump may require an inducer in order to be compatible with the available commercial off the shelf (COTS) electric motors. The initial pump sizing document began with the assumption that neither pump would require an inducer. The following document will make the opposite assumption and follow the methods prescribed in the Huzel and Huang [citation needed] text.\n",

    "## Pump specific speeds:\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments (not done by me) have shown that the actual pump efficiency does not significantly fall off with respect to speed, usually less than 2-3$\\%$. For a given pump design the relationship between the fluid flow rate ($Q$), the developed head rise ($\\Delta H$), and the rotational speed ($N$) can be defined by the so called 'Pump affinity laws' which are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Pump volume flow rate varies directly with speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \\frac{N_1}{N_2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Pump developed head rise varies with the square of the rotational speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta H_1}{\\Delta H_2} = \\frac{{N_1}^2}{{N_1}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Pump driving power varies with the cube of the rotational speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{hp_1}{hp_2} = \\frac{{N_1}^2}{{N_2}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with these parameters as defined by the motor requirements allows us to immediately derive the dimensionless pump specific speed ($N_s$) using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_s = \\frac{N(Q)^{1/2}}{\\Delta H^{3/4}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    " $N_s =$ Dimensionless suction specific speed  \n",
    " $N = $ Rotational speed of the pump [RPM]  \n",
    " $Q = $ Engine required flow rate [gpm]  \n",
    " $\\Delta H =$ Required head rise [ft]  \n",
    " \n",
    " This method of calculation requires that we choose an operating rotational speed. However reasonable numbers have been discussed as a result of the previous calculations and the currently available COTS electric motors capable of delivering the expected power requirements as being somewhere in the range of about 7000-15000 RPM.  \n",
    "**NOTE:** I will start at the lower end of these speeds and examine the effects of raising the rotational speed across the entire range of expected values.\n",
