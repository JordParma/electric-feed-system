    "Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) would like to determine how reasonable it would be to run an electric propellant feed system in our specific rocket (LV4) characteristics of which will be generated by [] optimization. To that end we will use a combination of sources to develop a process by which we can reasonably say under the following assumptions that:\n",
    "    1. This system will deliver the required pressure to the combustion chamber.\n",
    "        - Assuming negligable line losses between propellant tanks and pump inlet\n",
    "        - Assuming negligable line losses between pump outlet and injection aparatus.\n",
    "    2. This system will suppress cavitation with minimum tank pressure.\n",
    "        - Assuming tank pressure to be [] as determined from previous work.\n",
    "    3. \n",
    "    4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Items will be removed from the above list as the analysis gets more complex and approaches a useable tool."
