### ASSEMBLY

- [ ] Assemble shaft and bearing housings
- [ ] Assemble pump casing
- [ ] Assemble diffuser mod
- [ ] Verify/check fits and play in completed assembly
- [ ] Verify/check seals, bearings, and impeller clearances

-------------------

### CONTROL SYSTEMS

- [ ] Assemble of ESC to BL motor, receiver, battery [[NO BEC](https://github.com/psas/electric-feed-system/blob/master/Documentation/Spec%20Sheets/Electronics/Swordfish%20ESC%20manuals.pdf)]
- [ ] Assemble smooth, tight, water cooling tube to ESC
- [ ] Wire ESC to computer [[Use B-b config.](https://github.com/psas/electric-feed-system/blob/master/Documentation/Spec%20Sheets/Electronics/233180132-Swordfish-Plus-ESC-Manuals.pdf)]
- [ ] Complete bench test of motor/ESC to verify parameter settings
- [ ] Decide on PWM switching rate for most temp efficient operating conditions
- [ ] Integrate motor/ESC into EFS test assembly after bench testing is completed

##### ESC:

- [ ] Program/verify low voltage cut-off (LVC)
- [ ] Program/verify cut-off voltage/cell
- [ ] Program/verify Brake type parameter
- [ ] Program/verify Timing Advance
- [ ] Program/verify cut-off/startup type parameter
- [ ] Program/verify PWM switching rate
