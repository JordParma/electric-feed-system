### ASSEMBLY

##### Pump Chassis:

- [ ] Assemble shaft and bearing housings
- [ ] Assemble pump casing and main housing
- [ ] Assemble diffuser sleeves and flange
- [ ] Tap and assemble pump chassis fittings
- [ ] Verify/check fits and play in completed pump assembly
- [ ] Verify/check seals, bearings, and impeller clearances

##### Test Stand Plumbing:

- [ ] Size and cut aluminum tubing
