# Electric Feed System
This is an exploratory project looking into the possibility of using electric fuel/oxydizer pumps to generate inlet pressure required to run a []kN liquid fueled rocket engine

# Project requirements
* Design build and test a pump system capable of delivering the required pressure head to a bi-propellant liquid fuelled rocket engine. 
* Develop a comprehensive design tool that can be used to characterize future itterations of the pump project.
