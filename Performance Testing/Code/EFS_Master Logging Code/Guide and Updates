Delete all files from the SD card mounted to the shield before collecting any new data. Mount the SD shield with the cleared
SD card, and connect all the respective components, namely, thermocouple (wiring guide available at: https://github.com/psas/electric-feed-system/tree/master/Performance%20Testing/Sensor%20Calibration/Thermocouples),
pressure transducers (2), and flowmeter (wiring guide available at: TBD).
Flowmeter part of the code is subject to change, and will be updated accordingly.
